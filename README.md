# Custom-Editor

This is also an old Project of mine, which I found quiet fascinating back then.

## How it works

It basically grabs all the values of the HTML, CSS & JS Textareas, and puts them in a preconstruated HTML code.

If you don't know what I mean, just check the embed() function in the index.html file.

There is also a Settings option, but that is just cracked, it doesn't work properly.
